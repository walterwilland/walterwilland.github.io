# I used code pen to help tidy up my code, pretty swell and nifty tidy option they have over there :)
#
# Implementing javascript is hard and confusing, I suck at it and must learn to use it better, faster, and easier
# As soon as humanly possible.
#
# I've improved my css skills 10 fold, I feel like I know what I'm doing with that business, and I feel comfortable
# when selecting elements and adjusting what I want when I want visually. I had some in line styling which I know
# is a no no, but its gone now :)
#
# I felt as though I didn't have to change much from my original design which is great, just ui improvement and
# site functionality.
#
# Lastly, this is the first time I've added to this little read me thing, feels good to complain to & praise myself L.O.L.
