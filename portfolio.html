      <h3>Posterize Project</h3>
      <p>This composistion focuses on the use of font to create texture. The image is derived from the movie "Fight Club" and features the character of "Tyler Durden" played by Edward Norton. This poster depicts his face and various quotes from his character throughout the movie. The quotes are overlayed with the posterize effect creating a layered and textured hierarchy.</p>

      <h3>Map Typography</h3>
      <p>This project focuses on displaying a plethora of type. It's meant to represent an abstract depiction of my moring transit. The combination of words describes my journey to school down to the finest details. Some text patterns are set into paths to create shape and flow.</p>

      <h3>Beer Logo & Packaging</h3>
      <p>This is only a portion of a larger project, but the piece shows a logo I created advertising a local brand of hefeweizen. I transcribed everything text based into German. I chose Lucida Blackletter to add more to the German theme I was aiming at. The font is based of traditional German blackletter fraktur. The logo itself is vector and completely made by hand going from sketch to vector and then aligned to create a gestalt styled image represening a crown for the main logo.</p>

      <h3>Rhode Island Grid</h3>
      <p>I used an article for the content of this work. The focus of the project is to properly implement grid structure with both text and pictures. I chose fonts accordingly to match content, and signify importance to each particular portion of text. I also included a sidebar in the center to give the president of the school the most recognition and all other content pieces flow out from the middle. At the same time I keep it simple enough to read from top to bottom and left to right.</p>

      <h3>Trace Project</h3>
      <p>This was a very time consuming project where I took a real life photo and vectorized the entire image. Every part of the piece is a solid shape with no gradients. It was definitely a skill increase using the bezier pen tool in Adobe Illustrator. The colors are directly sampled from the photo as well.</p>
